SK(Kitchen)Sink is a library that no one should use. I mean it's not well tested, not well documented, not that uniform and it's just a large collection of things that I find useful between projects. Classes can and will change without notice. If you really like something in here then let me know and I'll consider breaking it into a smaller library. But for me it saves copy and pasting classes that I've developed between projects

## Components

SKObserverContainer
-------------------

This container makes it easy to set up observers for a single protocol. Use this when you want a delegate like pattern with multiple delegates.

SKQueueDeadlockDetector
---------------------

Class to help find deadlocks caused by serial queues.

SKServiceActor
--------------

The concept of an SKServiceActor is that it runs all operations internally on a serial queue and returns any results in a future. This allows for thread safety without being overly complex. It's similar to other Actor models but simplified due to not having to handle multiple instances and without limiting it to message passing which I find generally ruins an API.

SKServiceInjector
--------------

Useful for being able to setup a ServiceLocator class with the ability to override individual services. For a testable service architecture something like this is a must have

SQL folder
------

The SQL classes are wrappers around FMDB which work well with autogenerated models that I use in multiple places. This is a main candidate for refactoring into a separate pod.
